				Welcome!
      I wrote this book to help you quickly learn HTML and get familiar with
the advanced HTML topics.
HTML, a shorthand for Hyper Text Markup Language, is one of the
most fundamental building blocks of the Web.
HTML was officially born in 1993 and since then it evolved into its
current state, moving from simple text documents to powering rich
Web Applications.
This handbook is aimed at a vast audience.
First, the beginner. I explain HTML from zero in a succinct but
comprehensive way, so you can use this book to learn HTML from the
basics.
Then, the professional. HTML is often considered like a secondary
thing to learn. It might be given for granted.
Yet lots of things are obscure to many people. Me included. I wrote
this handbook to help my understanding of the topic, because when I
need to explain something, I better make sure I first know the thing
inside out.
Introduction
3
Even if you don't write HTML in your day to day work, knowing how
HTML works can help save you some headaches when you need to
understand it from time to time, for example while tweaking a web
page.
